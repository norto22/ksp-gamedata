    // descriptions
    #LOC_itep_efficientPropulsion_description = What if we made the engine bells longer? Well, here we are, with a set of efficient vacuum engines.
    #LOC_itep_highEfficiencyPropulsion_description = Our engineers have combined the mindset of bigger is better and have delivered a new set of engines, that will propel you further than ever before.
    #LOC_itep_higherEfficiencyPropulsion_description = At this rate, one starts to wonder how powerful the vacuum technology can get.
    #LOC_itep_veryHighEfficiencyPropulsion_description = When everybody thought it couldn't get better, R&D gave us these engines. We might need to investigate in order to stop this rapid technology progression!
    #LOC_itep_tremendousEfficiencyPropulsion_description = At this point you should reconsider why you would even need such big and powerful vacuum engines. Space is the limit!
