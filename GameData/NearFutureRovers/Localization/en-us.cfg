		#NFR-honeybadger-tank-titl = R32L Honeybadger Tank
		#NFR-honeybadger-tank-desc = When engineers came up with the idea of filling the passenger component with fuel, they had no objection. Unfortunately, the passengers were not removed beforehand.

	// Parts\Puma
		#NFR-puma-adapter-125-titl = R32M Puma 1.25m Adapter
		#NFR-puma-adapter-125-desc = He is blinded by any pain that may be of benefit unless it is the case. The exercise is anyone's fault.

		#NFR-puma-cockpit-titl = R32M Puma Cockpit
		#NFR-puma-cockpit-desc = "It looks nothing like a pig, I think it looks more like a puma"

		#NFR-puma-crew-enc-titl = R32M Puma Enclosed Crew Tank
		#NFR-puma-crew-enc-desc = Originally a fuel tank, it was drained and seats were fitted. Despite the conversion windows were not cut to regulation size (regulation stating that windows must be big enough for regulation games of i spy to take place), so inside is a rather claustrophobic environment. Because of this, the kerbals cannot perform crew reports.

		#NFR-puma-crew-titl = R32M Puma Crew Cabin
		#NFR-puma-crew-desc = Only slightly more expensive than a taxi.

		#NFR-puma-ladder-titl = R32M Puma Ladder
		#NFR-puma-ladder-desc = After it was realized that skydiving onto the Puma cockpit was a little excessive the engineers had the ordeal of designing a "vertical ascent device".

		#NFR-puma-side-fuel-titl = R32M Puma Side Storage - Fuel
		#NFR-puma-side-fuel-desc = Carrying resources was a focus point in the development of the Puma rover, so the side storage was developed. Warranty void if used to carry anything wet.

		#NFR-puma-side-mono-titl = R32M Puma Side Storage - MonoPropellant
		#NFR-puma-side-mono-desc = Carrying resources was a focus point in the development of the Puma rover, so the side storage was developed. Warranty void if description read.

		#NFR-puma-side-ore-titl = R32M Puma Side Storage - Ore
		#NFR-puma-side-ore-desc = Carrying resources was a focus point in the development of the Puma rover, so the side storage was developed. Warranty void if used to carry any ground related contents.

		#NFR-puma-tank-titl = R32M Puma Tank
		#NFR-puma-tank-desc = After most of the fuel tanks were converted into the hab boxes, some of them were cut in half and converted back to fuel tanks. The KSC praised the admin staff for their use of bureaucratic inefficiency and exorbitant allocation of work hours.
