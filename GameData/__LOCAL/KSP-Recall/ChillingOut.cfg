// This patch is a workaround to allow using ChillingOut on KSP 1.12, as default
// settings are only applied on KSP 1.11.0.
//
// However, I have reports that this **may** be needed on 1.12 under circunstances
// I didn't had the time to properly purse - and I was not exactly happy when I
// allowed ChillingOut to be installed on 1.12.0 by default.
//
// So, if some of you parts intantly blows up on spawns due enourmous ammounts of
// heat came from nowwhere, you will need to apply this patch on your installment
// in order to prevent the ICA (Instantaneous Craft Anihillation).
//
// Let me know if you need to use this, so I can evaluate the need of allowing
// it being activated by default on KSP >= 1.12
//
// If needed, copy this file to GameData/__LOCAL/KSP-Recall subdirectory.
